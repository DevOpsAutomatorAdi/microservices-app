# 🚀 DevOps Microservices Platform
### HTTP → HTTPS using Apache Reverse Proxy on AWS EC2

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **production-grade DevOps microservices architecture** deployed on **AWS EC2** using **Python Flask**, **Apache Reverse Proxy**, and **HTTPS with Let’s Encrypt**.

Multiple independent microservices run internally on HTTP and are securely exposed to users through **subdomain-based routing**. Apache acts as a **single secure entry point**, handling:

- Reverse proxy routing
- SSL termination
- HTTP → HTTPS redirection

A key highlight of this project is a **real-world HTTP to HTTPS migration**, which is a critical responsibility of DevOps engineers in production environments.

## 🧩 Microservices

| Service Name | Description | Internal Port |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Homepage Service | Central dashboard / landing page | 5000 |
| Orders Service | Independent backend microservice | 5001 |
| Payments Service | Independent backend microservice | 5002 |

## 🌐 Domain Mapping

| Public URL | Service |
|-----------|---------|
| http://aditechsphere.publicvm.com | Homepage |
| http://microservice1.aditechsphere.publicvm.com | Orders Service |
| http://microservice2.aditechsphere.publicvm.com | Payments Service |

> ⚠️ All HTTP traffic is permanently redirected to **HTTPS**.

## 🛠️ Deployment Guide

### 1️⃣ Launch EC2 Instance

- Ubuntu Server
- Open inbound ports: 80, 443
- Attach Elastic IP (recommended)

---

### 2️⃣ Install Required Packages

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv apache2 -y
sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http headers rewrite ssl
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

---

### 3️⃣ Setup Python Virtual Environment

```bash
mkdir ~/microservices-app
cd ~/microservices-app
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install flask
```

---

### 4️⃣ Run Flask Microservices

```bash
python homepage/app.py
python microservice1/app.py
python microservice2/app.py
```

Internal Ports:
- 127.0.0.1:5000
- 127.0.0.1:5001
- 127.0.0.1:5002

---

## 🔁 Traffic Flow

```
Browser → HTTPS → Apache → HTTP → Flask
```

---

## 🔒 Security Highlights

- Flask services bound to localhost
- Apache is the only public entry point
- SSL certificates auto-renew via Certbot
- Internal ports are not publicly exposed
- Clear separation of edge and application layers

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Kubernetes deployment
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana
- AWS ALB integration
